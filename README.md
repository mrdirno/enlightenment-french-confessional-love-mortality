## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where the historian, Élise, discovers a second, hidden artifact among Lucien's effects that contradicts his spoken confession.
- Imagine a chapter from Solène's perspective in 1968, detailing the moment she wrote the fateful letter.
- Create a modern-day interlude where a former student of Lucien's reads Élise's published document and is forced to re-evaluate their mentor.
- Draft a speculative 'alternate ending' where Lucien, in his youth, made a different choice, and trace its consequences in a brief vignette.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Silence Analyzer' tool that takes a text and highlights omissions, hesitations, and thematic gaps, visualizing the 'unspoken' structure of a confession.
- Create a dual-timeline narrative website where scrolling through Lucien's present-day confession in Paris seamlessly reveals fragments of the 1968 love story.
